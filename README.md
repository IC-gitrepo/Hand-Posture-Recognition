# Hand-Posture-Recognition
Cluster Analysis for Hand Posture Recognition

Dependency- MATLAB version 9.3.0.713579 (R2017b)

Unsupervised learning models for pattern recognition in hand posture data. Feature selection was performed by using Principle Component Analysis, followed by clustering using K-means Clustering and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithms. Dataset was taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MoCap+Hand+Postures
